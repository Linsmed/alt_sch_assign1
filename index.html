      <h3>About Section</h3>
      <p>Hello</p>
      <p>
        I'm Ejibode Ibraheem,a pharmacist and a student of AltSchool Africa and
        I'm currently enrolled in the Tinyuka Semester for the Cloud Engineering
        track.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Why AltSchool? </b>I have been into frontend engineering over a year
        now but I decided to transition into cloud engineering through ALTschool
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is what I want to achieve at the end of my programme in Altschool.
        At the end of a year, I aspire to be a seasoned cloud developer that
        would make impacts all over the world
